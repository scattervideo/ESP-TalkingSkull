üß† Talking Skull Project (ESPHome + Audio-Reactive Jaw)
Interactive Halloween Skull with Moving Jaw Synced to TTS or Audio
This project brings the classic ‚ÄúTalking Skull‚Äù prop to life using ESP32 boards, ESPHome, and audio-reactive servo control.
It‚Äôs based on the original JawDuino concept by Mike (Arduino + KA2284 LED sound meter) and has been modernized for ESPHome, allowing wireless control, TTS integration, and synchronization with Home Assistant.

üß© Overview
Two ESP32 devices work together:

ESP32 #1 (Audio)	Audio/TTS playback	Plays TTS or MP3 files using a MAX98357A I¬≤S amplifier.

ESP32 #2 (Jaw Control)	Servo motion	Moves the skull‚Äôs jaw in sync with sound amplitude captured from the audio line.

Audio output and control signals are shared between them through a safe resistor divider.

‚öôÔ∏è YAML File Descriptions
üéôÔ∏è esphome-jawservo ‚Äî Audio/TTS Controller
Handles text-to-speech playback and streams audio to the MAX98357A amplifier.
Key Features:
‚Ä¢	I¬≤S audio output via GPIO26 (BCLK), GPIO27 (LRCLK), GPIO25 (DIN)
‚Ä¢	Works as a Home Assistant media_player
‚Ä¢	Accepts local MP3/WAV playback or HA TTS commands
‚Ä¢	Syncs audio level signal to the jaw controller via resistor divider line to jawservo (22kohm each pin)

ü¶¥ esphome-jawservo.yaml ‚Äî Jaw Servo Controller
Controls the jaw servo based on the incoming audio amplitude.
Key Features:
‚Ä¢	Reads analog input (ADC) corresponding to audio amplitude
‚Ä¢	Smoothly moves the jaw servo proportionally to loudness
‚Ä¢	Allows testing and calibration modes through switches
‚Ä¢	Integrates with Home Assistant for manual control

üß∞ Custom Component: SoftRcPulseOut
Originally written by RC Navy, this library provides software-based servo pulse control with reduced jitter ‚Äî an alternative to the standard Servo library.
While the ESPHome version uses hardware PWM, the original Arduino version uses this for smooth analog servo movement.
Features:
‚Ä¢	Microsecond precision for servo pulse width
‚Ä¢	Handles multiple software-generated PWM outputs
‚Ä¢	Compatible with low-resource microcontrollers like ATtiny85

üîã Powering Everything
Use a regulated 5V power supply rated for at least 2A:
‚Ä¢	Servos can draw large transient currents.
‚Ä¢	Both ESP32s and MAX98357A share the 5V rail.
‚Ä¢	Use separate ground wires for audio and servo power to reduce noise.
If using a USB supply:
‚Ä¢	Power Audio ESP32 via USB.
‚Ä¢	Power Servo ESP32 via VIN with 5V directly.
‚Ä¢	Ensure grounds are common.

üß† Calibration & Tuning
1.	Start with the jaw servo disconnected.
2.	Use the ESPHome dashboard to monitor jaw_audio_level.
3.	Adjust the resistor divider or amplifier output for a dynamic range between 0.1V and 1.5V.
4.	Connect the jaw servo and fine-tune the servo movement range:
      o	Modify servo min_angle / max_angle in YAML.
      o	Optionally create switches for Jaw 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% test moves.
5.	Verify the jaw moves smoothly with speech and rests quietly between words.

Integration	Purpose
Home Assistant	Send TTS or MP3 files for playback
ESPHome API	Wireless control and synchronization
Alexa Media Player	Play TTS through the skull

‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
Issue	Cause	Solution
Scratchy audio	Shared ground loop or missing resistor divider	Add isolation resistors, confirm GND wiring
Jaw buzzes at rest	Servo holding torque too high	Add dead-band zone or relax servo after idle
No jaw motion	Wrong ADC pin or scaling	Check analog wiring and calibration
Servo jitter	Power noise from audio amp	Use separate power filtering capacitors
Couldn't combine code on single chip due to issues with i2s and ADC.
